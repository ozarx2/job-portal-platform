# Employer Dashboard Selected Status Fix

## âœ… **Added "Selected" Status to Employer Dashboard**

I've successfully added the "Selected" status option to the employer dashboard so that employers can mark candidates as "selected" for onboarding.

### **ðŸ”§ Issue Identified:**

#### **Problem:**
- **Candidate Dashboard**: Required "selected" status for onboarding access
- **Employer Dashboard**: Missing "Selected" status option in dropdown
- **Workflow Gap**: Employers couldn't mark candidates as "selected"

#### **Root Cause:**
The `statusOptions` array in `src/pages/EmployerDashboard.jsx` was missing the "Selected" status:
```javascript
// Before: Missing "Selected" status
const statusOptions = ['Applied', 'Shortlisted', 'Interviewed', 'Hired', 'Rejected'];
```

### **ðŸ”§ Fix Applied:**

#### **Updated Status Options:**
```javascript
// After: Added "Selected" status
const statusOptions = ['Applied', 'Shortlisted', 'Selected', 'Interviewed', 'Hired', 'Rejected'];
```

#### **Status Workflow:**
```
Applied â†’ Shortlisted â†’ Selected â†’ Interviewed â†’ Hired â†’ Rejected
```

### **ðŸ“‹ Complete Workflow:**

#### **1. Candidate Application Process:**
- **Apply**: Candidate applies for job
- **Shortlisted**: Employer shortlists candidate
- **Selected**: Employer selects candidate for onboarding
- **Onboarding**: Candidate can access onboarding documents

#### **2. Employer Management:**
- **View Applications**: See all job applications
- **Update Status**: Change candidate status using dropdown
- **Select Candidates**: Mark candidates as "Selected"
- **Track Progress**: Monitor application status

#### **3. Candidate Onboarding:**
- **Access Control**: Only "Selected" candidates can access onboarding
- **Document Upload**: Upload required documents
- **Form Submission**: Complete onboarding process

### **ðŸŽ¯ Status Options Available:**

#### **Employer Dashboard Dropdown:**
1. **Applied** - Initial application status
2. **Shortlisted** - Candidate is under consideration
3. **Selected** - Candidate selected for onboarding
4. **Interviewed** - Interview completed
5. **Hired** - Final hiring decision
6. **Rejected** - Application rejected

### **ðŸ“± User Experience:**

#### **For Employers:**
- **Status Management**: Can now mark candidates as "Selected"
- **Workflow Control**: Full control over application status
- **Onboarding Access**: Selected candidates can access onboarding

#### **For Candidates:**
- **Onboarding Access**: Available when marked as "Selected"
- **Clear Status**: Understand their application status
- **Document Upload**: Complete onboarding process

### **ðŸ”’ Access Control:**

#### **Onboarding Requirements:**
- **Status Check**: Must have "Selected" status
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/applications/selected`
- **UI Access**: Onboarding tab only available for selected candidates
- **Form Access**: Complete onboarding form available

### **âœ… Success Criteria:**

The fix is working correctly when:
1. **Employer Dashboard**: "Selected" status appears in dropdown
2. **Status Update**: Employers can mark candidates as "Selected"
3. **Candidate Access**: Selected candidates can access onboarding
4. **API Integration**: `/api/applications/selected` returns selected candidates
5. **UI Functionality**: Onboarding form is accessible for selected candidates

### **ðŸ“‹ Next Steps:**

1. **Test Employer Dashboard**: Verify "Selected" status appears in dropdown
2. **Test Status Update**: Mark a candidate as "Selected"
3. **Test Candidate Access**: Verify selected candidate can access onboarding
4. **Test Onboarding Process**: Complete document upload process
5. **Verify API**: Ensure `/api/applications/selected` endpoint works

The employer dashboard now includes the "Selected" status option, allowing employers to mark candidates as selected for onboarding, which enables candidates to access the onboarding process in their dashboard.
