# Dropdown and Reports Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Company Selection Dropdown Not Closing After Changes
**Problem**: The dropdown remained open after selecting a company, making it difficult to see the selection.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced the `onChange` handler to immediately update both `companyId` and `companyName`
- Added proper state management to ensure the dropdown closes after selection
- Improved the data flow to show the selected company name immediately

### 2. Test Companies Not Visible in Reports
**Problem**: Even though test companies were added to the dropdown, they weren't appearing in the reports section.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the `saveEdit` function to properly save company and job names
- Added comprehensive logging to track data flow
- Improved the reports fetching logic with fallback strategies
- Added debug information to see what data is being received

## Technical Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced LeadsTable Component

#### Company Selection Fix
```javascript
onChange={(e) => {
  if (editingLead && editingLead._id === lead._id) {
    console.log('Company selected:', e.target.value);
    const selectedCompany = companies.find(c => c._id === e.target.value);
    setEditingLead({ 
      ...editingLead, 
      companyId: e.target.value,
      companyName: selectedCompany?.name || ''
    });
  }
}}
```

#### Job Selection Fix
```javascript
onChange={(e) => {
  if (editingLead && editingLead._id === lead._id) {
    const selectedJob = jobs.find(j => j._id === e.target.value);
    setEditingLead({ 
      ...editingLead, 
      jobId: e.target.value,
      jobTitle: selectedJob?.title || ''
    });
  }
}}
```

#### Enhanced Save Function
```javascript
const leadData = {
  ...editingLead,
  // Ensure company and job names are properly set
  companyName: editingLead.companyName || 
    (editingLead.companyId ? companies.find(c => c._id === editingLead.companyId)?.name : ''),
  jobTitle: editingLead.jobTitle || 
    (editingLead.jobId ? jobs.find(j => j._id === editingLead.jobId)?.title : '')
};
```

### 2. Enhanced Reports Component

#### Improved Data Fetching
```javascript
const fetchShortlistedLeads = async () => {
  setLoading(true);
  try {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
    if (!token) return;

    console.log('Fetching shortlisted leads...');
    const response = await axios.get('https://api.ozarx.in/api/crm/leads?status=Shortlisted', {
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
    });

    console.log('Shortlisted leads response:', response.data);
    if (response.data.success) {
      setShortlistedLeads(response.data.data);
      console.log('Shortlisted leads set:', response.data.data);
    } else {
      // Try fetching all leads and filter client-side
      const allLeadsResponse = await axios.get('https://api.ozarx.in/api/crm/leads', {
        headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
      });
      
      if (allLeadsResponse.data.success) {
        const shortlisted = allLeadsResponse.data.data.filter(lead => lead.status === 'Shortlisted');
        setShortlistedLeads(shortlisted);
        console.log('Filtered shortlisted leads:', shortlisted);
      }
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error fetching shortlisted leads:', err);
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```

#### Debug Information Added
- Shows count of shortlisted leads
- Displays sample lead data structure
- Provides refresh buttons for manual data updates

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Test Company Dropdown
1. Go to Agent Dashboard â†’ CRM tab
2. Click "Add Test Companies" if not already done
3. Edit a lead and change status to "Shortlisted"
4. Select a company from the dropdown
5. **Verify**: Dropdown should close and show selected company name
6. Select a job from the job dropdown
7. Click "Save" to persist changes

### 2. Test Reports Display
1. Go to Reports page
2. Click "Shortlisted" tab
3. **Verify**: Should see debug information showing lead count
4. **Verify**: Should see shortlisted candidates with company/job assignments
5. If not visible, click "Refresh Shortlisted" button

### 3. Debug Information
The system now shows:
- **Companies loaded**: X (in Agent Dashboard)
- **Jobs loaded**: Y (in Agent Dashboard)
- **Available companies**: [list] (in Agent Dashboard)
- **Shortlisted leads count**: X (in Reports)
- **Sample lead data**: [JSON structure] (in Reports)

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Agent Dashboard
1. **Company Dropdown**: Closes after selection, shows company name
2. **Job Dropdown**: Closes after selection, shows job title
3. **Save Function**: Properly saves both IDs and names
4. **Visual Feedback**: Shows selected company/job immediately

### Reports
1. **Data Loading**: Fetches shortlisted leads with company/job data
2. **Display**: Shows company and job assignments in table
3. **Debug Info**: Shows data structure and counts
4. **Refresh**: Manual refresh buttons for data updates

## Troubleshooting

### If Company Dropdown Still Doesn't Close
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify that `editingLead` state is updating correctly
3. Check if the `onChange` handler is being called

### If Reports Still Don't Show Data
1. Check the debug information in Reports
2. Look at the sample lead data structure
3. Verify that leads are being saved with company/job data
4. Use the refresh buttons to reload data

### If Data Isn't Persisting
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify that the save function is being called
3. Check the network tab for API request/response
4. Ensure the lead data includes companyName and jobTitle fields

## Console Logs to Watch For

### Agent Dashboard
- `Company selected: [company_id]`
- `Saving lead data: [lead_data_object]`
- `Companies loaded: [count]`
- `Jobs loaded: [count]`

### Reports
- `Fetching shortlisted leads...`
- `Shortlisted leads response: [response_data]`
- `Shortlisted leads set: [leads_array]`
- `Filtered shortlisted leads: [leads_array]`

## Data Structure Expected

The lead object should now include:
```javascript
{
  _id: "lead_id",
  name: "Candidate Name",
  phone: "Phone Number",
  location: "Location",
  status: "Shortlisted",
  companyId: "company_id",        // NEW
  companyName: "Company Name",    // NEW
  jobId: "job_id",               // NEW
  jobTitle: "Job Title",         // NEW
  agent: { name: "Agent Name" },
  createdAt: "date"
}
```

## Conclusion

The fixes ensure that:
1. **Company dropdown closes after selection** and shows the selected company
2. **Job dropdown closes after selection** and shows the selected job
3. **Data is properly saved** with both IDs and names
4. **Reports display the assignments** correctly
5. **Debug information** helps troubleshoot any remaining issues

The system now provides a complete workflow from selection to display in reports.
